# Overview
This project involves building an autonomous obstacle-avoiding car using an Arduino Uno and an Adafruit Motor Shield, developed as part of the EENG 348 course. The car is capable of detecting obstacles in its path using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor, allowing it to navigate around obstacles without human intervention. The car is battery-powered and can operate independently without being plugged into a power source.

# Features
**Obstacle Detection:** The car uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to detect obstacles in its path. The sensor continuously scans the environment and sends distance data to the Arduino.

**Autonomous Navigation:** Based on the distance readings, the car makes decisions to move forward, turn left, or turn right to avoid obstacles.

**Motor Control:** The Adafruit Motor Shield controls four DC motors, enabling precise movements of the wheels.

**3D Printed Base:** The chassis of the car is 3D printed, providing a lightweight and durable frame for the electronics and motors.

**Battery-Powered:** The car is powered by batteries, allowing it to operate without being plugged in, making it fully mobile and independent.

**Future Expansion:** Plans to add a radio transceiver module for remote control, allowing manual operation of the car.
